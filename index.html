   <span><h3>About me:</h3></span>
   <p>
       I'm computer engineering student in 3rd grade. I have been interested in programming since childhood. I'm also interested in electronics and robotics. I have gained business discipline thanks to my internship and work experiences. I am a responsible, hard-working and self-motivated person who is always eager to achive the best. Eventhough almost always I handle the problems I encountered by myself, I am also suitable for teamwork. I have good communication skills and always been a solution-oriented person in the work environment. I also take care to keep up to date about today's technology and innovations.
