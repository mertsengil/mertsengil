    <h2>What is Metaverse?</h2>
    
    <p>
        
        -->Metaverse, a term first used in sci-fi, is the negotiation of the prefix "meta" and "universe" with time. Land refers to the virtual worlds  associated with the site, the avatars and even the names, which can be bought and sold, with the exchangeable currency team. They can walk around with these habitable people, buy buildings, buy goods and services, and attend events.
    </p>
       <P>
        -->The term covers a wide range of virtual realities, from workplace tools to games and community platforms.
        Most of the new platforms are powered by blockchain technology using cryptocurrency and immutable tokens (Nfts), allowing a new type of    decentralized digital asset to be created, owned and monetized.

    <h2>Importance In The Game World?</h2>
    <p>
        Metadata store can be broadly divided into two different types of platforms.

The first focuses on building a blockchain-based metadata warehouse using NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox allow people to purchase virtual parcels of land and create their own environments.

The second group, more generally, uses metadata to refer to virtual worlds where people can gather for work or play. Facebook Inc announced in July that it has formed a product team to work on the metadatabase.

Game platforms where users can compete, collaborate and create their own games, Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft fall into this category.

In Neal Stephenson's 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash, the term refers to the convergence of physical, augmented and virtual reality in a shared online space. Earlier this month, The New York Times investigated that companies and products like Epic Games' Fortnite, Roblox and even Animal Crossing: New Horizons are increasingly having metaverse-like elements. (Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has been discussing his desire to contribute to a metaverse for months.)

    <h2>The Future of Metaverse:</h2>
    <p>
        It is unclear to what extent a true metaverse that fully replicates real life is possible or how long it will take to develop.

Many platforms on the blockchain-based metadatabase are still developing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology that will allow users to fully interact in space.

Accounting and consulting giant PwC estimates that VR and AR technologies will provide the global economy with a $1.5 trillion boost by 2030, compared to $46.5 billion in 2019. The news continues with Turkey's most comprehensive news website, Haberler.com.

Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are investing in cloud computing and investing in VR companies in anticipation of growth.
